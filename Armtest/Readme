Armtest is a small program running on an Arduino which provides a drive signal to PWM controlled
servos. 
The control input is from a serial input in teh format x,y where x is teh number of the servo to be controlled, and y is the set angle. 
Movement to the set angle is at a measured pace, not immeadiately.
